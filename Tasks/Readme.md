# Task1 UART:
Perform a simple calculator using UART where the following scenario happens:
    -An Arduino that generates 2 floats and certain operation (float1 operator float2)
    -This data will be sent to second arduino which will perform the calculation.
    -Second Arduino returns result back to First arduino which will print result.

# Task2 Making a Reliable UDP:
    - Make a server and receiver files
    - Each file has a starting number= 0 (which resembles the last packet number received)
    - The client should request the next packet by sending to the server the next number.
    - The server receives the request and then send the required packet.
    - When the client receives the packet it increments the number and the loop repeats.

# Task3 Read the UIP_UDP file
    -The repository link: https://github.com/UIPEthernet/UIPEthernet.git
    -Make a small report about your understanding of this file.
