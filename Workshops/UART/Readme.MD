Build a simple UART project consists of 2 arduinos:

1-Connect TX pin of an Arduino to the RX pin of the other and vice versa.
2-Connect the GND of both Arduinos.
3-Make an Arduino send data every 1 second using Serial.write
4-Make the other arduino read the data using Serial.available and Serial.read
